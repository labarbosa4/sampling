# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
   
   The sample should represent our target population well, thanks to stratified random sampling. By separating current employees and recent departures, we capture both perspectives. This dual approach is crucial for understanding turnover. 
   
   Random selection within each group also helps reduce bias and we will get a broader range of experiences across departments this way. Still, some limitations may exist as recently departed employees might have different opinions compared to those that are still with the company. They could also be less likely to respond to the survey, impacting overall results.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```

    The updated survey focuses on making questions clearer, more respectful, and easier to answer. For example, questions were split or rephrased to avoid confusion, and sensitive topics now include options like "Prefer not to answer" to respect privacy. Open-ended questions now have examples to guide responses, and a note about anonymity was added to encourage honesty. Sensitive questions were moved to the middle to create a smoother flow. These tweaks aim to make the survey more approachable while ensuring better, more accurate results.

    
    "This survey is anonymous, and your responses will remain confidential. No personal identifiers are collected, ensuring your privacy. Thank you for your participation!"

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No, this survey‚Äôs purpose couldn‚Äôt be fully met with just an observational study. Observational studies are better for spotting trends or behaviors as they happen naturally. However, they do not fully show people's motivations, attitudes, or personal reasons. All of the previous atributes are essential for understanding turnover. 
    
    Surveys let us go straight to the source, gathering direct feedback and reflections from employees. These insights are not visible through observation alone. While observing could show us who is leaving and when, it would not capture the ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù which is crucial for designing strategies to improve retention.
    ```
