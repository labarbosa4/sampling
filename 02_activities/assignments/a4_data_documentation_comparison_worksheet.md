| Sample type                                           |This survey was conducted using random digit dialing (RDD) for sample selection, with additional in-person follow-ups to ensure response accuracy.                                                                                            |The CES used a panel survey approach, consisting of a two-wave panel: a Campaign Period Survey (CPS) and a Post-Election Survey (PES). Respondents were selected using an online panel provided by Qualtrics, which was designed to be representative of the Canadian population.                                             | This study utilized observational data, supplemented by behavioral experiments on bats in both natural and controlled environments.                                                                                       |
| Sample size                                           |The sample size is not explicitly mentioned in the document excerpts, but the GSS typically involves a large representative sample across Canada, which would be in the thousands.                                                                                            |The Campaign Period Survey (CPS) involved 37,822 respondents, while the Post-Election Survey (PES) re-contacted 10,340 respondents from the CPS.                                             |A total of 112 Glossophaga soricina bats were captured during the study, with 38 faecal samples analyzed for dietary assessment.                                                                                      |
| Target population                                     |The target population includes Canadian residents aged 15 and older, focusing on those engaged in activities like volunteering, giving, and social participation.                                                                                             |The target population includes Canadian citizens and permanent residents aged 18 or older, representing adults eligible to vote in Canadian federal elections.                                            | The target species is Glossophaga soricina, a nectar-feeding bat that also consumes fruits and insects.                                                                                            |
| Sampling frame                                        |The sampling frame consists of households with eligible members in Canada, contacted primarily through telephone numbers gathered using the RDD approach.                                                                                            |The sampling frame was composed of Canadian residents, and respondents were recruited via Qualtrics' panel. The sample was stratified by region, gender, and age to ensure a balanced representation of the Canadian population.                                             |The bats were captured using mist nets in the Area de Conservación Guanacaste, Costa Rica, during specific months in 2009.                                                                                          |
| Survey mode(s)                                        |The target population includes Canadian residents aged 15 and older, focusing on those engaged in activities like volunteering, giving, and social participation.                                                                                             |The data was collected through an online survey administered via Qualtrics. Surveys were conducted in both English and French, ensuring accessibility to a broader audience.                                             |The study included field surveys for capturing bats, as well as behavioral experiments conducted on a captive colony to assess feeding habits.                                                                                             |
| Timeline                                              |The survey was conducted in 2018.                                                                                            |The Campaign Period Survey (CPS) took place from September 13th to October 21st, 2019, and the Post-Election Survey (PES) was conducted from October 24th to November 11th, 2019.                                             |Data collection spanned 7 weeks, from late May to early July 2009.                                                                                   |
| Response rate                                         |The document does not specify the exact response rate. Typically, response rates for such surveys can vary, and additional information might be found in supplementary reports.                                                                                            |The response rate for the follow-up PES was aimed at 50%, but was not always met. Specific response rates for the overall sample are not explicitly provided in the documents.                                             |66% of the captured bats provided faecal samples that were solid enough to analyze for dietary content.                                                                                           |
| Weights                                               |Person weights (WGHT_PER) are applied to the dataset to make it representative of the broader Canadian population.                                                                                            |The survey dataset includes weight variables to ensure that the sample is representative of the Canadian population. Weights were generated using an iterative raking process, considering province, gender, age, and education level.                                             |No information on weighting of data was provided, as this was not a survey-based dataset.                                                                                            |
| Data processing                                       |Data is processed by categorizing different responses and using weighting procedures to ensure the representation of demographics.                                                                                            |The dataset underwent extensive data cleaning to remove incomplete, ineligible, and duplicate responses. Quality checks were implemented to flag inattentive respondents and identify duplicates based on IP addresses and demographic matches.                                             |DNA barcoding was utilized to identify insect fragments in the diet, and acoustic and behavioral techniques were used to understand insect capture mechanisms.                                                                                        |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            |Details about cleaning or imputation are not provided in the document, but it is standard for national surveys to undergo data cleaning to handle inconsistencies.                                                                                            |Respondents flagged as speeders (those completing the survey too quickly), straightliners (those giving identical responses across grid questions), and duplicates were removed. Inattentive respondents were flagged but kept if their responses were deemed potentially useful.                                             |Manual alignment of DNA sequences was performed during analysis. Behavioral data involved synchronizing video and audio recordings for detailed examination of feeding actions.                                                                                            |
| Sources of error                                      |Possible sources of error include nonresponse bias, as some individuals or households might be unreachable or unwilling to respond. Additionally, social desirability bias may affect responses, especially in questions about volunteering or charitable donations.                                                                                            |Sources of error may include sampling biases, particularly for regions with limited panel availability. Self-selection bias is inherent in online surveys, as well as possible inaccuracies in respondents’ reporting of their opinions and demographics.                                             |A limited reference database for insects prevented complete species identification, and some insects could only be partially matched.                                                                                       |
| Limitations, known biases                             |The survey is susceptible to social desirability bias, where respondents may overreport positive behaviors like volunteering or charitable contributions. Moreover, sampling errors due to the RDD approach could also affect results                                                                                            | The survey may suffer from response biases due to the online nature of data collection. Self-selection bias may also be present, as respondents choose to participate voluntarily. Additionally, sampling limitations in certain regions, particularly in the territories, affect the representativeness of those areas.                                             |The study had biases due to a limited reference database, making it difficult to identify all insect species consumed. Additionally, not all bats produced faecal samples, which may have underrepresented insect consumption.                                                                                             |
