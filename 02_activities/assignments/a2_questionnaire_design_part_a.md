# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `#1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey is to identify key factors driving high turnover rates among entry- and lower-level employees. By understanding employees' reasons for leaving and gathering feedback on job satisfaction, the company can design strategies to improve retention.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: Entry- and lower-level employees at the company, including both current employees and those who have left within the last year.

Sampling Frame: A company database listing all employees in entry- and lower-level roles, segmented by current and recently departed (within the past 12 months).

Sampling Units: Individual employees within the target population.

Observational Units: Survey responses collected from each employee.
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
Sampling Strategy:

To ensure representativeness, we would use stratified random sampling. The target population will be divided into two main strata: (1) current employees and (2) former employees who have left within the last year. Within each stratum, employees will be randomly selected to participate, ensuring proportional representation from various departments and levels within entry- and lower-level roles. This approach will allow us to capture both current satisfaction levels and the factors influencing turnover decisions.
